            In an organization project manager generally work with multiple projects, multiple teams, team members. 
            Often it happens, he misses out some of the minute details like who is working on what at the current point of time. Also, sometimes it may happen, in a day some team members are too busy but some are free. 
            We have to build a system which will help the project manager in creating a to-do list for the project and help to show the status of the system at any given point of time.
